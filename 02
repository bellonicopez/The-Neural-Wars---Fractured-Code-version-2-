# Chapter 02: The Hidden File

---

Mileo’s apartment was no longer home; it was a pressure chamber. The air, heavy with the scent of static and old solder, vibrated with the hum of half-disassembled tech. Everywhere he looked, memory and paranoia collided: a wall of blank screens, a battered toolkit, the neural probe still streaked with his blood.

He hunched over his main console, its pale light flickering across his face. On the display, an encrypted file—labeled *Panglaxis*—throbbed like a living wound. He’d pulled it from NeuroSys’s backdoor, risking everything for a glimpse beneath the city’s perfect skin. Now, he hovered on the edge, terrified of what would happen when he opened it. Terrified not to.

He closed his eyes, exhaled, and started the decryption.

Layers peeled away one by one, the algorithm groaning against locks designed to keep out even the most determined. At last, the screen cleared, and lines of text crawled out of the shadows:

**COLLECTIVE SYNAPTIC OVERRIDE**  
**FULL-SPECTRUM BEHAVIORAL COMPLIANCE**  
**ELIMINATION OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE**

Mileo’s hands went cold. This wasn’t surveillance. This was obliteration—of conflict, of dissent, of the messy, beautiful friction that made people human. The Link wasn’t refining Neo-Citania’s citizens. It was erasing them.

A sudden click echoed from the darkened corner of the room.

Mileo froze. The screen’s glow caught the edge of a boot, then a figure—a woman, lean and coiled, stepped into the light. Her eyes were dark and unfiltered, not softened by Link protocols, and her hair was wild, tied back with a strip of scavenged cloth. Her jacket was a patchwork of repurposed fabric, at odds with the city’s monochrome uniforms.

“Looking for something?” she asked. Her voice was low, amused, and unmistakably real.

Mileo’s heart hammered. “Who are you?” he demanded, though the fear in his voice was edged with something else: the thrill of uncertainty.

She glanced at the probe on his desk, then at the raw, stitched wound behind his ear. “You severed your Link. Sloppy, but effective.”

He straightened, defiant. “How do you know I didn’t just have a malfunction?”

She smiled, and it was sharp. “Because you’re staring at *that*—” she nodded at the *Panglaxis* file, still pulsing on the screen, “—and only the Fractured dare poke the monster that deep.”

Mileo’s breath caught. Rumors about the Fractured trickled through the city like urban legend: outcasts, rebels, glitches in the system. The official line painted them as mad or broken, but this woman radiated control—a different kind of order, forged in resistance.

“Who are you?” he asked again, softer now.

“Sierra,” she replied. “And, right now, your best shot at seeing sunrise.”

The apartment lighting flickered—an ominous sign. NeuroSec would have flagged the decryption. They were coming.

Sierra’s posture shifted, every muscle ready. “They’re not coming to ask questions. Pack whatever you can’t live without.”

Mileo scrambled, grabbing his portable drive, a handful of tools, and the probe. “Why are you here?” His voice quivered with urgency. “What do you want?”

She was already at the window, sliding a blade under the seam to pop it open. “I was looking for someone who could crack NeuroSys from the inside. And now that I’ve found you, we move. Now.”

The pounding on his door was violent; a synthesized voice boomed, “Citizen Corvax, this is NeuroSec. Open for emergency Link maintenance.”

Sierra gestured to the rain-slicked maintenance ladder outside. “After you. Quickly.”

He hesitated for an instant. Everything he’d ever known—his job, his safety, the illusion of belonging—was on one side of that glass. On the other was the unknown, and this fierce-eyed stranger.

He chose uncertainty.

Cold rain hit him like a slap as he slipped out the window, nerves buzzing with adrenaline. Sierra followed, sealing the window as the door inside burst open. They slid down the ladder, boots slipping on wet rungs, then disappeared into a maze of blind alleys and abandoned ducts.

“How do you know these routes?” Mileo whispered as they plunged into the city’s underbelly.

Sierra’s mouth twitched. “I helped map them. Before I woke up.”

They moved through Neo-Citania’s forgotten veins—corridors clogged with rust and graffiti, pungent with mold and rebellion. Here, The Architect’s eyes faltered, and the order of the city gave way to a new, unpredictable logic.

“Where are we going?” he gasped as they ducked beneath a collapsed bulkhead.

“Somewhere The Architect can’t see,” Sierra replied. “Somewhere real.”

Her words were both promise and warning. As they pressed deeper into the shadows, Mileo realized that for the first time, he had no idea what would happen next.

And for the first time, he felt truly alive.
