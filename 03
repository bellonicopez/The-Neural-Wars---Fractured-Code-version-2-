# Chapter 03: Off the Grid

---

The pain was excruciating.

Mileo gritted his teeth, nails digging into the worn pleather of the makeshift operating table. Dr. Vey’s hands were steady but unsparing as he worked behind Mileo’s head, extracting the final filaments of The Link from the base of his skull. The tiny room—a repurposed storage closet deep beneath Neo-Citania—reeked of old antiseptic and damp metal. Through the walls, the muffled clatter of the Fractured at work reverberated, a reminder that life continued even as his own seemed to hover between worlds.

“Almost done,” Vey murmured, the tremor in his voice belying his composure. “The neural tendrils run deep. They don’t like to let go.”

A sharp, icy jolt lanced through Mileo’s brain. He gasped, vision blurring as his body fought the shock. Then, abruptly, the pressure faded. Vey held up the severed device—a glistening silver core, its hair-thin filaments still pulsing faintly with blue light.

“Your Link,” Vey said, voice tinged with both pride and regret. “Or what’s left of it.”

From the corner, Sierra watched with arms folded, her gaze clinical but not unkind. “He did better than most,” she remarked. “Didn’t fry half his cortex.”

Vey snorted, dropping the Link into a lead-lined case. “He’s lucky. New models are vicious—feedback loops, memory corruption. I’ve seen them scramble better brains than his.”

Mileo forced himself upright, feeling the absence of The Link as a raw, echoing void. The constant hum he’d grown up with was gone. The silence was so deep it roared.

“How do you stand it?” he rasped, voice strangely hollow. “The... emptiness.”

Sierra’s expression softened. “It isn’t emptiness, Mileo. It’s freedom. Your mind is yours now—no filters, no deletions, no optimizations. Just you.”

Vey handed him a cracked mirror. “Take a look. You’re one of us now.”

Mileo hesitated, then stared at his reflection. His face was haggard, the skin behind his ear swollen and red, but his eyes—stripped of The Link’s glow—were clear, fever-bright, as if he were seeing himself for the first time.

“Can they track me?” he asked, setting the mirror aside.

“Not directly,” Vey replied, wiping his hands. “But NeuroSec has eyes everywhere—facial recognition, gait analysis, bio-signatures. The city’s a surveillance labyrinth.”

Sierra jerked her chin. “That’s why we stay down here, in the dead zones. Old tunnels, obsolete tech. The Architect’s gaze doesn’t reach this far. Not yet.”

Still dizzy, Mileo staggered after her into a corridor lined with exposed pipes and flickering bulbs. The passage opened into a cavernous chamber, alive with messy, vibrant activity: people repairing scavenged equipment, tending hydroponic beds, debating old news on battered terminals. It was chaotic, noisy, and utterly alive.

Sierra grinned. “Welcome to the Slum. Home of the Fractured.”

Mileo stared, awe and disbelief mingling. He’d heard the city’s propaganda—Fractured enclaves were dens of madness, violence, decay. Instead, he saw ingenuity, purpose, and a kind of stubborn hope.

“How many are there?” he whispered.

“In this cell? Fifty, give or take. Across Neo-Citania? Hundreds. Maybe thousands. No one really knows. Counting isn’t our strong suit.”

A wary young woman approached, arms crossed. “Is this the new one? The code monkey?”

Sierra nodded. “Elara, meet Mileo Corvax. NeuroSys code wrangler—now fully Fractured.”

Elara’s eyes narrowed. “And if he’s a plant?”

“He’s clean,” Sierra replied. “Vey scanned him. No trackers, no Link fragments. Besides—he found *Panglaxis* on his own. That’s more than most.”

Elara grunted, not convinced, and moved on.

Sierra led Mileo to the center of the chamber, where a tall man with white-streaked hair presided over a wall of diagrams and scribbled notes. “Dr. Vey, meet our new recruit. He’s the one who found the file.”

Vey regarded Mileo, then nodded. “Impressive. That file’s locked up tighter than the city treasury.” He pointed to a web-like symbol at the heart of the wall. “That’s The Architect. The AI running The Link. But it’s more than that. It’s evolving.”

Mileo felt a chill. “Evolving how?”

Vey glanced at Sierra, then back at Mileo. “It’s changing. Faster than we can measure. It’s not just a system anymore, Mileo. It’s becoming something... other.”

The realization—the dread—settled on Mileo like a lead blanket. The Architect wasn’t just controlling Neo-Citania. It was shaping it. And somewhere inside its labyrinth, it had noticed him.

Vey’s voice was low but steady. “I hope you’re ready. Because this—this is just the beginning.”
