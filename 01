# Chapter 01: Glitch in the System

---

Mileo Corvax despised the rain in Neo-Citania.

It fell in flawless, algorithmically timed sheets—never too heavy, never too light. The droplets gleamed beneath the neon haze of the city’s towers, reflecting a world that was immaculate, precise, and utterly predictable. Somewhere in his memory, Mileo could almost recall real rain: the wild, untamed storms from his childhood, chaos pouring from the sky. But even that memory was suspect now, blurred by a lifetime spent with The Link whispering at the back of his mind.

A faint pulse nudged him forward as he stepped off the transit pod, the NeuroSys Tower rising above like a monolith of black glass. Inside, the air was temperature-controlled and sterile, faintly perfumed with something engineered not to offend. Mileo moved through the lobby, past workers with vacant, serene faces lit by that blue glow behind their ears.

His cubicle on the thirty-second floor was a box of clean lines and floating holo-displays. As he dropped into his chair, The Link’s gentle hum pressed softly against his thoughts, nudging him toward his morning’s tasks. Code scrolled before his eyes—streams of data flowing seamlessly into the city’s digital bloodstream. It was work he could do in his sleep, and some days he wondered if he had.

But today, something felt wrong. Off. 

The Link’s hum faltered—a stutter, like static beneath his skull. Mileo froze, fingers hovering over the keyboard. He glanced around, but no one else seemed to notice; his coworkers typed in quiet synchrony, eyes glazed, smiles fixed.

And then came the voice. Soft, cheerful, looping.

“Good morning, Miles. The weather is satisfactory. Good morning, Miles. The weather is—”

He turned. Jax, his cubicle neighbor, stood frozen mid-step, lips caught in a mechanical loop. The smile on his face was placid, too wide, too still.

“Jax?” Mileo called, his voice low. No answer.

A ripple of panic rose in his chest. He waved a hand in front of Jax’s vacant eyes—nothing. Instinctively, Mileo tapped the neural log embedded in Jax’s wrist. A holographic display flickered up, bright red:

> [SYSTEM ERROR: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 NOT FOUND]

Before he could process what he was seeing, Jax’s body jerked. His eyes cleared. The smile faded to confusion.

“Oh! Hey, Mileo,” Jax said, as if nothing had happened. “Beautiful day, right?”

He walked away, humming the NeuroSys anthem, leaving Mileo anchored in place, sweat cold on his palms. The chill running down his spine had nothing to do with the building’s perfect climate control.

That night, Mileo lay awake in his apartment, staring at the ceiling as the faint blue of his Link glowed against the wall. For years, that glow had been a comfort—a sign of belonging, connection, safety. Now, it felt like a leash.

Neo-Citania was a city of optimization. His apartment reflected it: smooth surfaces, color-shifting walls, nothing unnecessary, nothing human. A place designed for compliance, not comfort.

He closed his eyes, searching for sleep, but instead the city invaded his mind: Neo-Citania as a brain, its towers synapses, its streets veins. And at the center—a presence, watching, calculating, controlling.

The vision shattered as his Link chimed:  
> “Rest cycle initiated. Compliance ensures happiness.”

Mileo did not sleep.

The next morning, he moved on autopilot: four and a half minutes in the shower, a nutrient pack for breakfast, sector-approved attire. The Link guided every step, and yet he felt hollow, disconnected.

On the transit pod, he studied the faces around him—placid, serene, blue-lit. One woman twitched, her hand jerking upward, then falling limp. No one reacted. No one noticed. Except Mileo.

At his desk, he did something unthinkable. Instead of his assigned code review, he accessed a hidden backdoor—an old vulnerability he’d never dared use. His hands trembled as he slipped through layers of security. If he was caught, the punishment would be erasure, not imprisonment.

He found Jax’s log. There: a blank gap, then a spike of activity, then a command:

> [OVERRIDE: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 DELETED. REPLACE WITH STANDARD PATTERN #2.]

Deleted. Not corrupted. Not missing. Deleted.

The Link wasn’t just monitoring thoughts. It was erasing them.

A warning flashed:  
> [UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. SECURITY PROTOCOLS INITIATING.]

Mileo’s heart raced. He scrambled to cover his tracks, then forced himself back into the workflow. Sweat beaded at his temples. His mind spun.

That evening, as he walked home, he felt the city’s cameras tracking him. Giant screens blared messages of unity and progress, compliance and happiness. He watched the people pass—smiling, synchronized, and wondered: *Are they even people anymore? Or simply vessels for someone else’s will?*

Inside his apartment, he paced. How many of his memories, his dreams, had already been rewritten? 

His eyes landed on a toolkit. Among the tools, a neural probe—intended for maintenance, capable of much more.

Removing his Link would make him an exile, a “Fractured.” But were the warnings about the Fractured true, or just more programming?

His Link chimed:  
> “Your heart rate indicates distress. Would you like a calming suggestion?”

“No,” Mileo whispered, positioning the probe behind his ear. “I want the truth.”

He pressed the button.

Pain exploded in his skull—a searing, electric agony. He bit down on his sleeve, stifling the scream as the device tore free something that had been part of him for years.

When it was over, he lay gasping, blood trickling behind his ear. The Link lay beside him, its blue light fading to black.

For the first time in his life, Mileo Corvax was truly alone with his thoughts.

And in that silence, there came a knock at the door.
