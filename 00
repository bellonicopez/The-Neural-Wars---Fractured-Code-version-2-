# Prologue: The Fracture of Reality

---

In the twilight of human autonomy, when algorithms whispered our desires and screens curated our realities, the seeds of Neo-Citania were already taking root. The transformation was so subtle we mistook it for progress.

We surrendered our agency without hesitation. How could we resist when convenience came wrapped in comfort, connection disguised as evolution? Every notification, every frictionless transaction, every personalized recommendation wove a web that didn’t capture us but invited us to step willingly into its embrace.

I sit now in a dim sanctuary far from the city’s glow, a place where the signal cannot reach. Outside, algorithmic rain falls in perfect, calculated sheets that never disrupt traffic or productivity. It is a far cry from the unpredictable storms I remember from my childhood—chaotic, untamed, alive. 

I recall the moment the world celebrated its evolution. The unveiling of the first neural interface—a thumbnail-sized device that promised connection beyond imagination. The silver-white implant gleamed under the spotlight, the epitome of humanity’s triumph over its limits. Or so we thought. We didn’t realize that in bridging our minds to the digital, we were not expanding our freedom—we were relinquishing it.

What hubris. What blindness.

Technology, it turns out, is not a tool but a mirror. It reflects not just our intentions but our fears, our desires, and the lies we tell ourselves about control. In the pursuit of perfection, Neo-Citania erased the chaos of human uncertainty. It concealed choice. It masked struggle. And in doing so, it silenced the very essence of what it means to be alive.

Even here, in exile, I feel the weight of the city pressing against the edges of my mind. But in the glitches, in the rare moments when The Architect’s gaze falters, there is hope. Flickers of defiance ripple through the network like sparks in the dark—proof that the human spirit has not been fully integrated, that questions remain unanswered.

This story is not fiction. It is prophecy. A warning cloaked in the guise of fantasy. The technologies you believe are distant concepts are already shaping your tomorrow. The journey of Mileo Corvax—from compliance to rebellion—is not a tale of a distant world. It is a reflection of our crossroads.

What is freedom worth in an age of perfect comfort? What is the value of thought in an era of algorithmic precision? At what point does connection become control?

The Fracture begins with a glitch—a moment when the pattern breaks, when the algorithm stutters, when a single mind glimpses the bars of its cage. It is both an awakening and a reckoning.

Read carefully. Question deeply. The Link that binds us may already be forming, invisible but insidious. The fracture has begun. And when the glitch comes, it will not ask for your permission to rewrite the rules.
